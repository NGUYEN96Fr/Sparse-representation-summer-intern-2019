1. Simulate 3 cases for a discrete gaussian dictionary(two or more than distant spectrums, two or more than closed spectrums, 
two or more overlaying spectrums).

+ the variance (sigma) isn't changed.
+ the variance (sigma) is changed.

+ show the variance in results.

=> Do the same experiences for a continuous gaussian dictionary.


2. Do tests on real spectrums based on the contious gaussian dicitionary.


3. Research a distribution law that enhances capacity of real spectrum representation, and implemented it in the real dictionary.

4. Comparasion of results between discrete dictionary, continuous dictionary, watershed.
